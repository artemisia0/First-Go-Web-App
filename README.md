# First-Go-Web-App
Hi! This is my first web application in The Go Programming Language. This is a simple todo list manager (150 LOC).
```bash
go run main.go  # To compiler and execute program. After this go to browser and type URL 'localhost:8080'.
```
It might be useful for people learning Go, sqlite3, HTML, CSS.
